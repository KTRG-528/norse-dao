ÓÐALRÉTTARYFIRLÝSING
(Declaration of Allodial Right and Sovereign Status)

KUNNGJØRING TIL ALLE SOM VEDKOMMER
(Notice to All Whom It May Concern)

I, _________________________ (birth name), a living man/woman of the land, do hereby declare and make known:
I. LANDNÁM - CLAIM OF ANCESTRAL RIGHT
I am a free and sovereign soul, born upon the land now called Norge (Norway), descended from the ancient lineages who held these lands under óðalrétt (allodial right) since time immemorial.
I claim my birthright as Óðalsmaðr/Óðalskona (Allodial Man/Woman), which existed before any corporate municipal or territorial overlay, and which cannot be surrendered, borrowed, or transferred by any legal fiction.
II. REJECTION OF MUNICIPAL/TERRITORIAL STATUS
I do NOT consent to be:

A "citizen" of any corporate municipal entity established post-1969
A "resident" subject to territorial jurisdiction
A legal fiction/strawman under admiralty or commercial law
A debtor or surety for any governmental corporation

III. ASSERTION OF SOVEREIGN STATUS
I hereby reclaim and assert my standing as:
LEVENDE MANN/KVINNE (Living Man/Woman)

Status: Óðalsmaðr/Óðalskona (Sovereign Landholder)
Jurisdiction: Landrétt (Law of the Land), not corporate/admiralty
Assembly: Member of [Name] Bygðarþing (Village Thing)
Authority: Self-governing under Alþingi (All-Thing) tradition

IV. LEGAL STANDING UNDER NATURAL LAW
My rights derive from:

Náttúrulög (Natural Law) - inherent to my existence
Óðalrétt (Allodial Right) - ancestral connection to land
Ættarétt (Kinship Right) - blood and soil sovereignty
Þingréttr (Assembly Right) - self-governance tradition

These rights pre-exist and supersede all statutory, municipal, and territorial constructs imposed after 1969 or any other date of corporate overlay.
V. INTERNATIONAL LAW FOUNDATION
This declaration is made under:

UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007) - Articles 3, 4, 5, 33
Natural Law - pre-governmental human rights
Customary International Law - recognition of traditional governance systems
Allodial Title Doctrine - absolute land ownership without feudal obligation

VI. PARTICIPATION IN BYGÐARÞING (LOCAL ASSEMBLY)
I hereby join and participate in [Name of Local Assembly] Bygðarþing as a Þingmaðr/Þingkona (Assembly Man/Woman) with full voice and vote.
I recognize the authority of:

My local Höfðingi (Coordinator) - chosen by the assembly
The Lögsögumaðr (Law Speaker) - keeper of ancient law
The Fylkesting (County Assembly) - regional coordination
The Riksting/Alþingi (National Assembly) - national coordination

All authority flows FROM the people TO the assembly, never the reverse.
VII. RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS
My Rights:

Self-governance and self-determination
Freedom of movement on the land
Property held in allodium (absolute ownership)
Assembly participation and voice
Trade and commerce as free man/woman
Protection of person, family, and property

VIII. NOTICE TO GOVERNMENT ENTITIES
This declaration serves as formal notice that:

I do not consent to be treated as a corporate fiction or statutory "person"
All interactions must be with me as a living man/woman on the land
I operate under common law/natural law jurisdiction, not admiralty/statutory
Any claims against me must be brought before my Bygðarþing with an injured party
I waive NO rights and reserve ALL rights at all times

IX. REVOCATION OF IMPLIED CONTRACTS
I hereby revoke, rescind, and make void any and all:

Implied contracts with municipal/territorial governments
Presumed benefits or privileges that create obligation
Adhesion contracts signed under duress or without full disclosure
Voting registration that implies federal/territorial citizenship
Any other presumed agreement I did not knowingly and willingly enter
