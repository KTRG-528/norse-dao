traditional Norwegian roles in Norse mythology, particularly the gods in Midgard (the realm of humans) and Asgard (the realm of the gods), and how they functioned like a government structure.
Here are the major Norse gods and their administrative/societal roles:
Odin - All-Father, chief of the gods, god of wisdom, war, death, and poetry. He ruled Asgard and oversaw all divine matters.
Frigg (Freya is a different goddess) - Odin's wife, queen of Asgard, goddess of marriage, motherhood, and domestic affairs. She had knowledge of fate.
Thor - God of thunder, protector of both gods and humans, defender against giants. He maintained order and protection.
Freya - Goddess of love, beauty, fertility, and war. She also received half of those who died in battle and was associated with magic (seidr).
Freyr - God of fertility, prosperity, and fair weather. He ensured good harvests and peace.
Tyr - God of war, justice, and law. He presided over legal matters and oaths.
Heimdall - Guardian of Bifrost (the rainbow bridge), watchman of the gods.
Loki - Trickster god, not an administrator but involved in many divine affairs.
Baldr - God of light, purity, and beauty, beloved by all.
